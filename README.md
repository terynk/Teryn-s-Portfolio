This took me about a week to finish. I had this website from before but it was a base skeleton. I added descriptions of my projects and more to the Experience section. I made the timeline. I also changed the colors to have consistent colors throughout the website. I mainly focused on content and styling since the base layout was already there. I made cover images on Canva to make the work section more cohesive.
